The city's history dates back to around 890, as found in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple<br> 
in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537, Kempé Gowdā, a feudal ruler under the<br> Vijayanagara Empire, established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore<br>
and its oldest areas, or pétés, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence;<br>
in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and <br>
Bangalore came under Shahaji Bhonsle as a jagir, which later became his capital.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
