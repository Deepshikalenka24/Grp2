        <h1>Hyderabad</h1>
        Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana.<br>
        It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River,<br>
        in the northern part of Southern India.
        With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around <br>
        artificial lakes,including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of<br>
        the city centre.According to the 2011 Census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in <br>
        India with a population of 6.9 million 
        residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan <br>
        region,making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad has the <br>
        fifth-largest urban economy in India.<br>
        The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital<br> 
        beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. <br>
        In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also<br>
        known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahi's from 1769 to 1948.<br>
        As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment<br>
        until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a<br>
        capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of<br>
        1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh.<br>
        In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became<br>
        the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024.<br>
        Since 1956,the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.<br><br><br><br><br>
